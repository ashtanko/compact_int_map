/// CompactIntMap is a lightweight implementation of an integer-keyed map that
/// efficiently stores key-value pairs using two parallel lists for keys and
/// values. It supports operations such as adding, updating, retrieving, and
/// removing mappings, along with utility methods to get the size of the map,
/// clear it, and clone its contents.
